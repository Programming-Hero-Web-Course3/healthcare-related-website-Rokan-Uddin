[{"id":1,"name":"ORTHODONTICS","description":"Orthodontics is the treatment of improperly positioned teeth. We can use functional appliances as well as fixed braces which apply gentle pressure to move teeth into the desired position. Orthodontics straightens teeth, brings your bite into alignment and improves both the appearance and function of your teeth. Crowded, crooked or protruding teeth are more difficult to keep clean and are vulnerable to gum disease as you age. Treatment may take anywhere from several months to a couple of years, depending on the nature of the problem. Treatment during childhood usually takes less time because the teeth and jaws are still developing. Treatment for both children and adults can be achieved with excellent results. Invisalign treatment will be available in the near future.","shortdescription":"Orthodontics is the treatment of improperly positioned teeth.

Crowns are placed over your weakened or decayed tooth after they are reduced in size, to allow the crown to fit over the tooth like a thimble. A bridge replaces a missing tooth by placing crowns on the teeth on either side of the missing tooth and another false crown is attached between them to replace the missing tooth. Crowns are extremely durable and require only the same care as your own teeth.","shortdescription":"Crowns and bridges are usually made out of porcelain or metal alloys and they will strengthen and protect your teeth as well as enhance your smile.","url":"http://www.farazydental.com/images/services-icon-image/1537771063.png"},{"id":4,"name":"DENTURES","description":"Partial and complete dentures can be fabricated for patients who are missing many, or all of their teeth.

Gum disease, otherwise known as periodontal disease, attacks the bone, ligaments and gums that support your teeth. Early symptoms are red, puffy gums that bleed when brushed or flossed. You may also experience a bad odour or taste in your mouth. As infection progresses, space may appear beween the teeth, gums may recede and teeth will loosen. Without treatment, periodontal disease leads to tooth loss. Fortunately, with early diagnosis, periodontal disease can be successfully treated at almost any stage. Our hygiene department will effectively assess, treat and recommend the proper professional and at home care of each of our patients. Through proper treatment, the loss of teeth can be prevented and everyone can keep their teeth for a lifetime.","shortdescription":"Periodontal therapy treats gum infections caused by the bacteria in plaque.

We have used this product for our patients for over ten years now and it is gentle on the teeth and our patients are ecstatic with the results.
